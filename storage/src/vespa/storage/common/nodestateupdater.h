/**
 * @class storage::NodeStateUpdater
 * @ingroup common
 *
 * @brief Interface to implement for handler of state updates
 *
 * This component is responsible for keeping the node and system state, and
 * make it available to all components that want to access it. For thread
 * safety it returns shared pointers to states, such that state objects
 * retrieved are still valid after changes.
 *
 * If you're using the state so much that copying the shared pointer is too
 * much, you can instead add yourself as a state listener, and keep your own
 * copy of the state.
 *
 * When you set a new reported state, pending get node state requests will be
 * answered, so do all your updates in one call.
 *
 * This interface exist so the storage server interface is not implementation
 * dependent, and such that the state updater can be easily faked in tests.
 *

## Number of separate threads that runs visitors.
## Keep in sync with #stor-filestor:num_visitor_threads

## Default timeout of visitors that loses contact with client (in seconds)
disconnectedvisitortimeout int default=0 restart

## Time period (in seconds) in which to ignore requests to visitors that doesnt
## exist anymore. (Normal for visitors to get some messages right after
## aborting, logging them as faults instead after this timeout has passed.)

## The number of buckets that are visited in parallel in a visitor visiting
## multiple buckets. Default is 8, meaning if you send a create visitor to visit
## 100 buckets, 8 of them will be visited in parallel.
defaultparalleliterators int default=8

## Default number of maximum client replies pending.
defaultpendingmessages int default=32

## Default size of docblocks used to transfer visitor data.
defaultdocblocksize int default=4190208

## Default docblock timeout in ms used to transfer visitor data.
## Currently defaults to a day. This is to avoid slow visitor target problems,
## getting data resent faster than it can process, and since there are very few
## reasons to actually time out

## Default timeout of visitor info messages: Progress and error reports.
## If these time out, the visitor will be aborted on the storage node.

## Max concurrent visitors (legacy)
maxconcurrentvisitors int default=64

## Priority-based max concurrent visitors. Fixed is the total number of
## concurrent visitors that can run for any priorities. Variable
## increases the concurrency limit for higher priorities, the limit
## being linear with a messages priority. Example: if Fixed is 16
## and Variable is 64, maxconcurrent for a pri 255 message is 16 and
## maxconcurrent for a pri 0 message is 16+64=80.
## If fixed is left as 0, it will take the value of maxconcurrentvisitors,
## allowing backwards compatability

## Max size of visitor priority queue
maxvisitorqueuesize int default=1024

# Limit of memory used _per visitor_ in bytes.
# Due to optimistic parallelization, it is possible for this limit to be
# initially violated when the visitor is first started. This can happen since
# the visitor does not know the size of the bucket contents before fetching
# any data from it and it will do so based on parallelization factors specified
# in the CreateVisitor command. If 3 buckets are initially visited in parallel
# and these both contain a single 100 MiB document, the memory usage of the
# visitor will peak at 300 MiB even if the configured limit is e.g. 20 MiB.
# Default value is set to 20 MiB, which attempts to keep a reasonably safe
# level in the face of a default number of max concurrent visitors (64).

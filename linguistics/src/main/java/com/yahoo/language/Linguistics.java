/**
 * <p>Factory of linguistic processors. For technical reasons this provides more flexibility to provide separate
 * components for different operations than is needed in many cases; in particular the tokenizer should typically
 * stem, transform and normalize using the same operations as provided directly by this. A set of adaptors are
 * provided that makes this easy to achieve. Refer to the {com.yahoo.language.simple.SimpleLinguistics} implementation
 * to set this up.</p>
 *
 * <p>Thread safety: Instances of this factory type must be thread safe but the processors
 * returned by the factory methods do not. Clients should request separate processor instances
 * for each thread.</p>
